# PureScript validation exercises

Working through Joe Kachmar's `purescript-validation` exercises from LambdaConf.

## Goals

* [X] Go through the exercises in [this workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S84vOaTpR18) (concentrating on the semigroup instance of `V`) porting the examples to PureScript 0.12 as I go.

* [ ] Same for the [second half](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kz4QgBW3P9k).

* [ ] Incorporate whatever I can from [this article](https://qiita.com/kimagure/items/f75befebdd37f6e8879f) and/or from [`home-run-ball`](https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-home-run-ball).

* [ ] Try to decipher how Arthur Xavier makes [this wizard example](https://medium.com/fuzzy-sharp/purescript-and-haskell-at-lumi-7e8e2b16fb13).

* [ ] See if [this](https://asciinema.org/a/214727) is relevant.

* [ ] Incorporate results into a basic React app.
